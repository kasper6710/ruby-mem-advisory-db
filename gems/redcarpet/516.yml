title: Memory Leak in Redcarpet::Render::Base
date: 2015-09-11
description: |
 rb_redcarpet_rbase_alloc used to allocate a struct rb_redcarpet_rndr instance
 which was never freed.

 This caused 312 leaked bytes (on a 64-bit machine) on every render call
leaky_versions:
  - "< 3.3.3"
patched_versions:
  - ">= 3.3"
